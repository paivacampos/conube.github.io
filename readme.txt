**v.2**
A lot of changes in the code (bs3 and what not), so if you have site already in production, it is recommended to leave it there, or just copy paste your content into the new Story. Feel free to write if you have any questions.

- Updated to Bootstrap3
- A lot of code cleanup. A lot. 
- Actually added the 5 vectors, really no one noticed? :)
- Menu back to bootstrap`s, as it got better in v3
- Menu in mobile view shows Brand now.
- Font-awesome updated
- The Story now supports almost all bootstrap`s components. 

**v.1.1**
- Rewrote whole navigation, as bootstraps default one seemed to be buggy for this particular use. Now it uses CSS3 animations, and is even faster on mobile phones.
- Fixed issues with menu on iOS.
- Added jquery.history, now you can use back button.
